# Overview

For more important features and refactorings, you can write design documents first:

1. Ease of review
2. Filed for retention so that the original idea can be recalled years later
3. Technical publicity, for users with technical pursuits, design documents are a powerful aid to gain user trust.

## Precautions

For the design of key features, when the documentation is written, POC (prototype verification) code should be written at the same time, and the Demo should be deployed.

Design documentation without a POC is not guaranteed to be well thought out.
